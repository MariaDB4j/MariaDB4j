This library is dual licensed under the Apache License 2.0 & the Eclipse Public License v1.0.
The ASL and EPL licenses, instead of GPL, have been chosen so that non-GPL Java applications
can use this.

As such, note that this library must never "combine" with GPL licensed code.
The pure "distribution" of the GPL licensed MariaDB binaries with this JAR is OK, as
this Java library never "links" to those binaries, but merely "launches"
them a separate OS process (non shared address space).

Here is a link to MariaDB's GPL license:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/faq/questions-about-licensing-mariadb-plugins-etc/mariadb-license/

Here is a link allowing you to download MariaDB's source code:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/documentation/getting-started/compiling-mariadb-from-source/source-getting-the-mariadb-source-code/

Note that you have to figure out yourself whether you can use the MySQL(R) JDBC driver (Connector/J) from Oracle in your application.
The MySQL(R) JDBC driver (Connector/J) is GPL licensed, but due to the MySQL FLOSS License Exception,
it "permits linking with other components that are licensed under OSI-approved open source licenses".

The MariaDB JDBC driver, AKA "MariaDB Client Library for Java Applications"
from <https://downloads.mariadb.org/client-java/> may be of interest to you in this context.

http://kb.askmonty.org/en/mariadb-faq-is-there-any-java-connector-for-mariadb-than-the-one-from-mysql
says that For most cases there is no license requirement for using the JDBC connector as the GPL for
the connector will not affect your application because you have the JDBC manager in between.
See the Licensing FAQ <http://kb.askmonty.org/en/licensing-faq> for details.
